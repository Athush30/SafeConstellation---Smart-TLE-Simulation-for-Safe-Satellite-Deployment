# 🛰️ Safe Constellation: Smart TLE Simulation for Satellite Deployment

This project simulates a real-time collision-aware satellite deployment system using Python and [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/). It validates and adjusts the TLE (Two-Line Element) data of a new satellite before adding it to an existing constellation.

## 🚀 Features

- Load existing constellation from `tle_data.txt`
- Simulate a new satellite's trajectory using TLE
- Detect potential collisions with existing satellites
- Automatically adjust orbit (inclination) to avoid collisions
- Log all events in `events_log.csv`
- Append collision-free TLEs to the constellation

## 🧪 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` should include:

```
skyfield
numpy
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Load the existing constellation:

```python
load_constellation("tle_data.txt")
```

### 2. Add a new satellite and check for collision:

```python
add_new_satellite(tle1, tle2, "NEW-SAT")
```

- If a potential collision is detected, the system attempts to adjust the inclination angle (`delta_deg`) iteratively.
- If successful, the adjusted TLE is added to the constellation.
